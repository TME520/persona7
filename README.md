# Persona/7
An Open Source personal assistant
## A guardian angel with silicon wings
[Apple Siri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri), [Gatebox Hazuma Hikari](https://www.gatebox.ai/en/), [Microsoft Cortana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana), [Samsung Bixby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bixby_(virtual_assistant)) and [Google Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Assistant) are fairly advanced products with an impressive range of features, but interacting with them is never totally satisfying. This is due to the fact they have a limited grasp of the human social space, making their interactions pretty shallow most of the time. Users are never sure of what they can ask and tend to stick to basic questions, renouncing to hold any meaningful conversation with their virtual assistants.

Pretending to do better than these (mostly) big corporations with their big money and their armies of big brains would be perfectly ridiculous: I am no genius myself and my resources are very limited. This repository is simply there because I need a place to experiment; I don't expect to achieve anything ground breaking.

*Persona/7* is my humble attempt at transforming virtual assistants into *personal* assistants, always looking after you, always having your wellbeing and best interest in mind. You can see *Persona/7* as a guardian angel with silicon wings.
## We already have tons of these
True, I'm well aware of that fact. As said in the previous section, this project is simply there for me to experiment, see what I can do in the field of virtual assistants.
There is no ego behind this, it's not a vanity project, simply curiosity and a taste for trying things.
## What would it look like ?
Milestone 1 is very likely to be a Slack bot. I can't see further than that and I would be the happiest man on Earth if *Persona/7* got that far.
